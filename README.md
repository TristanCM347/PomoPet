Pitch https://youtu.be/Ykg-Qdo-MGY

## Inspiration

Help and motivate proper time management. Research indicates that gamifying aspects of your life can help motivate the users (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321630855X).

## What it does

This app gamifies the Pomodoro technique by providing a cute little tomato who sleeps while you study, and plays games with you in your break. After a few Pomodoro cycles, your tomato buddy then encourages you to go out and do some physical activity! Encouraging a healthy lifestyle and proper studying.

## How we built it

We built the frontend on React together with PixiJs. We had four members stationed on the frontend side, and two on the backend. For the backend, we made a nodejs server with express, using postgresql for our database and PassportJS to help facilitate the authentication process.

## Challenges we ran into

We started parts of the website in raw html with javascript. We decided to use React, so we had to translate a lot of javascript/html to fit with the React framework.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Managing to finish the prototype, in spite of changing ideas and requirements.

## What we learned

We should prepare the structure of the project and further attempt to establish what technologies we should be using. Also making sure that everybody involved with the specific technologies are somewhat familiar or motivated to work with the technology.

## What's next for PomoPet

We're going to look towards streamlining the game loop, and possibly deploying the app onto a service provider such as Amazon. Additionally, we'll attempt to provide a module that infers what an optimal physical activity for the user is, based on geo-spatial information along with previous user history.
